# Arduino BLE Indoor Bike Fitness Machine

This project uses two ESP32 boards to emulate an expensive indoor bike trainer and a power meter.<br/>
<br/>
One ESP measures power and cadence on a crank, the other receives these values, emulates a trainer and forwards the data. It also receives the simulation parameter from a computer and sets position of the resistance screw accordingly.<br/>
The data is also displayed on a 12864 screen and the user is able to change the resistance in ERG mode and the gears in simulation mode.<br/>
The user can also load a file with resistance values and times when to set them on an SD card.<br/>
<br/>
I will publish a full instructable later
